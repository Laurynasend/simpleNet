# simpleNet

Framework meant for creating simple dense and convolutional neural networks with zero effort.

simpleNet provides you with options written below.

Neural nets:

1. Dense
2. Convolutional

Activation functions:

1. ReLU
2. Sigmoid
3. Softmax
4. Linear

Loss functions:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. Binary Crossentropy
4. Categorical crossentropy

Optimizers:
1. Vanilla SGD
2. AdaGrad
3. RMSProp
4. Adam

Regularizers:
1. L1
2. L2

Extra:
1. Dropout layers (great way to fight with overfitting)
2. Easy model creation and training
3. Easy saving and loading of parameters or the whole model


Comments - simpleNet was a great way to broaden my knowledge on a subject that is on the forefront of almost every new AI research or inovation - Deep Learning. This project helped to get a better grasp of neural network fundamentals which are a necessity for creating advanced real - life solution oriented AI's.


Great book that guided me through the beginning of Deep Learning journey - Neural Networks from Scratch in Python by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in neural networks, but do not know where to start.
